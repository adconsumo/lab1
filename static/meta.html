        Launch CS:GO and select ‘Workshop Maps’ in the dropdown menu. Select the
        map from the list.
        Aim training is arguably one of the most important things you can do in CS:GO
        whenever you're taking a break from playing against other people. Sure, you could
        spend a significant amount of time only playing against real people, but that may
        not be the most optimal way to practice shooting.
        As a new player, learning how to aim accurately should be number one on your list
        of priorities. Of course, there are a number of other vital bits of information you’ll
        need to learn in addition to this, but if you are struggling to aim against moving
        targets then you are going to have a big problem.
        Training_aim_csgo2 has you firing at circles on a board as opposed to Terrorists
        [Ts] / Counter Terrorists [CTs] that you would find in a game. Shooting circles on a
        board doesn’t sound like it would be too helpful, but it won’t take long before you&#39;re
        clearing them instantly as they appear.
        To track your progress, the map displays exactly how many targets you’ve hit and
        missed. This will be helpful in showing how much you’ve improved after an hour of
        aim training.
        You can spice things up by choosing one of the five training modes, and if that isn’t
        enough for you, you can always make the target smaller to make things that much
        harder.
        Practice aiming at the circle targets with each type of weapon CS:GO has to offer.
        You may find it easy to shoot the targets with an assault rifle, but it gets a lot
        harder when you start to use something with lower accuracy.

    <p class="txt">
        Launch CS:GO and select ‘Workshop Maps’ in the dropdown menu. Select the
        map from the list.
        This is probably the most popular - as well as the simplest - method of aim / reflex
        training for CS:GO, used by pros and newbies alike.
        The training is pretty simple: select the CT side and you’ll spawn on a plinth in the
        middle of the map. From here on out, Ts will continue to run towards you from all
        angles and your task is to take them out at your leisure. You’ll start off holding an
        AK-47 and a Desert Eagle, but can switch weapons whenever you see fit.
        While many versions of this map exist, this is easily the best one available on the
        Steam Workshop, as it gives you the option to tweak some of the training
        conditions.
        Players can enable a headshot barrier, for example, which displays a striped line
        marking exactly where your crosshair should be resting to hit consistent headshots
        every time. You can also choose between three bot speeds: 50%, 100% and
        150%.
        More bots can be added or removed from the map, depending on how challenging
        you’d like the course to be, and you can even enable ‘Free Mode’ which places you
        on the floor, with the bots, meaning that they can damage you if you let them get
        too close.
        For the best results, you’ll want to spend a long time training on this map, and due
        to its simple nature, this may feel a bit tedious after the first few minutes. Consider
        popping on a podcast or television show in the background.
        While longer sessions will lead to better results, we recommend that you also use
        this before booting up a competitive game - just to get nicely warmed-up.

    <h1 class="head"> CS:GO Best Recoil Training Maps </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        Map Name: Recoil Master - Spray Training
    </p>
    <p class="txt">
        Creator: uLLetica
    </p>
    <p class="txt">
        Launch CS:GO and select ‘Workshop Maps’ in the dropdown menu. Select the
        map from the list.
        As we mentioned in our previous guide to the best weapons in CS:GO, there are
        certain weapons that are incredibly powerful but also come with the drawback of
        having a heavy recoil effect.
        One of the things that separates the professional players from everyone else is
        their mastery of every spray pattern in the game. While you should be aiming for
        every one of your kills to be as efficient as possible (one bullet headshots), we all
        know this is very difficult to do.
        Learning how to spray in CS:GO teaches you how to be as accurate as you
        possibly can be when forced to fire several bullets at your target. Each weapon
        comes with its own unique spray pattern. If you want to save some time you can try
        to focus on the two most popular weapons in the game: the AK-47 and the M4A4.
        The Recoil Master map aims to streamline the spray training learning process by
        giving you all the information you need on two walls. The wall on your left features
        all the weapons CS:GO has to offer. You don’t even need to walk up to the wall,
        you can shoot the weapons from spot you spawn onto the map.
        Once you’ve picked up the weapon you want to master, look at the main wall and
        get to practicing. Above the shooting area is a screen that displays the spray
        pattern of the gun you are holding. You can try to memorise this, or you can enable
        the ‘Ghosthair’ setting that displays exactly where you should have your crosshair
        depending on how many bullets you’ve fired.

    <h1 class="head"> CS:GO Best Prefire Training Maps </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        Map Name: Yprac Practice and Warmup Mods

    <p class="txt">
        This will download the practice arenas for a number of different maps. Please note
        that each map has its own Arena, e.g. ‘Yprac Dust2 Arena’.
        Launch CS:GO and select ‘Workshop Maps’ in the dropdown menu. Select the
        arena for your desired map and, while standing on the platform in the middle of the
        arena, select ‘Prefire Practice’.
        Prefiring is the action of anticipating where an enemy may be standing and
        shooting before you actually see them. It commonly occurs nearer the beginning of
        a round, and is often utilised by a player who is pushing around a corner, checking
        an angle or attempting a wallbang. Prefiring works on both T and CT-sides and can
        quickly disorientate a team.
        Prefire maps are incredibly valuable as they’ll not only encourage you to improve
        your crosshair placement, but also make you aware of common spots where
        opponents will likely be lurking. These maps offer the full range of CS:GO’s arsenal
        and varying levels of difficulty, where the bots will attack you. You can also select
        the bots’ weapons, armour and a number of other game conditions. This map
        enables you to measure how quickly you’re improving as each map starts a timer
        once you select your conditions and weapon.
        Incorporating Prefire training into your regime will make you a better competitive
        player. Before hopping into a competitive match, consider which maps you’ll be
        queuing for and practice your prefiring skills before hitting that search button.
        A quick run through A, B and Mid prefire spots will suffice if you’re itching to start a
        match, but if you find that you have more time to practice, try multiple runs to beat
        your best time.
        Knowing where the enemy may be and going into each round prepared to take
        them on in specific areas greatly diminishes the element of surprise, giving you the
        upper hand.

        Prefiring will catch your opponent off-guard and - when perfectly timed - will result
        in you eliminating them before they even have a chance to take a shot. Be mindful
        of how much ammo you’re using per prefire though.
        The more you practice, the more accurate your prefire shots should be as you’ll
        learn to naturally rest your crosshair in the optimum position. The AK-47 is a lethal
        prefire weapon but if you’re playing on the CT-side, consider switching to the M4A4
        for more ammo.

    <h1 class="head"> CS:GO - Weapons </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        CS:GO’s home to a number of weapon, each with their own price and
        characteristics which can make it difficult to know which ones are worth spending
        your hard earned cash on.
        In this section we’re highlighting all of the guides that’ll help you get a better idea of
        what the strongest weapons are, and how you can improve your skills at handling
        them.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head"> USP-S </h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 140</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 70</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        Equipped with a silencer, the USP-S has higher damage than the T-side Glock-18
        and can prove to be incredibly accurate when trying to hit those pistol-round
        headshots.
        The USP-S is a good pick for players who are looking for clean, precise shots and
        is consequently less likely to be recommended for beginners, who may appreciate
        the extra ammo of the P2000.
        This pistol will save a Counter-Terrorist [CT] having to buy in the first round and
        provides a lethal 140 damage to an unarmoured Terrorist [T]. Note, however, that
        this damage halves once a helmet is equipped, rendering it less effective in
        subsequent rounds.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">GLOCK-18</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 118</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 55</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        A weaker starter pistol than its CT counterpart, the Glock-18 has surprisingly high
        recoil control as well as a decent rate of fire.
        Thanks to its large magazine and surplus of reserve ammo, players are
        encouraged to send out multiple shots in quick succession when hoping to hit a
        target.
        This is further supported by the pistol’s burst-fire mode that can be
        activated/deactivated on the fly by tapping right-click once.

        The Glock-18’s short reload times and respectable running accuracy make it a
        cheap and cheerful pistol for rushing bombsites.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">P250</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 151</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 96</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        Arguably the best upgrade on offer for pistol rounds, the P250 has superior
        damage and armour penetration over the starter pistols, making it a strong tool in
        opening rounds as well as eco rounds, later on.
        Best utilised by players proficient in tapping rather than spamming, its small
        magazine and reserve ammo are slightly larger than that of the USP-S, rendering it
        a smart choice over a Glock-18 on T-side.
        Providing openings for players to land longer-range headshots, the P250 can be
        purchased by both teams and can deal considerable damage on armoured
        opponents at certain ranges.
        Despite its late-2017 nerf that removed its fatal one-tap headshot abilities, at just
        $300 the P250 can still provide solid results over the course of a match.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">CZ75-Auto</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 123</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 95</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        Clocking in at $500, the CZ75-Auto is the only fully automatic pistol in CS:GO.
        Purchasable by both teams, replacing the Five-SeveN on CT-side and the Tec-9
        on T-side, this pistol has even higher armour penetration than every SMG in the
        game, making it incredibly powerful in capable hands.
        However, with only twelve rounds in its magazine and the same in reserve, this
        weapon only proves to be lethal for the most disciplined players, with the best
        results occuring at close ranges.
        Strong recoil and and a high rate of full-auto fire make this one difficult to control,
        yet as demonstrated by countless pro players, once mastered a few accurate shots
        with the CZ can end a round in no time.

        Don’t let the low kill award deter you from picking this weapon. Use the CZ to kill
        enemies and take their dropped weapons.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">Desert Eagle</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 249</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 232</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        At $700, the Desert Eagle (commonly referred to as the Deagle) is reserved only
        for those who are extremely confident in their aiming ability.
        No other pistol in the game has similar damage output compared to the Deagle
        when fired at a distance. This pistol has a high learning curve though, as a single
        missed shot can prove to be costly thanks to the weapon’s high recoil and low rate
        of fire.
        Of all the pistols listed in this guide, the Deagle is the only one we would not
        recommend using during the early rounds of a match.
        The extremely high price of the Deagle places it firmly as a mid-late game option
        for those hoping to snatch a round against armoured opponents.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">MP9</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 104</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 61</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        The perfect follow-up after a successful pistol round, the MP9 serves as the
        cheapest SMG on the CT-side.
        Often praised for its high rate of fire alongside its notable movement and jump
        accuracy, the MP9 can land one-hit headshots on unarmoured opponents,
        cementing it as a reliable early-game weapon.
        Quickly peaking, sending out a short burst of fire and then resuming your initial
        position can prove infuriating for approaching Ts, and with that tasty 200% kill
        award weighing in at $600 per elimination, players will want to maximise their
        ‘spray and pray’ action with this weapon.
        Fast reload times and a sufficient reserve of ammo also make the MP9 a viable
        option for ‘rush’ rounds.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">GALIL AR</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 120</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 92</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        A welcome addition for those times when you can’t quite afford an AK-47, the Galil
        AR can prove to be sufficient for those awkward rounds when the entire team is a
        bit strapped for cash. With a high rate of fire and respectable armour penetration
        power, the Galil is well worth its $2,000 price tag.
        Falling slightly short of fatal headshots on armoured opponents, close range
        interactions are usually won via spraying, whereas long-range engagements
        require sensible taps with this weapon.
        While the Galil will never be a player’s first choice, it is perfectly capable of winning
        force-buy rounds, enabling players to upgrade to an AK shortly afterwards.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">FAMAS</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 120</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 84</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        Early on in the game when both teams are unable to purchase their preferred
        assault rifles, the FAMAS is usually the go-to choice for CTs.
        The FAMAS is the only assault rifle in the game to feature the three round burst
        ability. Activating the burst fire mode makes the FAMAS more accurate and
        reduces recoil, though you need to be sure your shot is going to hit because there
        is a much bigger delay when firing compared to the full-automatic mode.
        The FAMAS may not stack up compared to the main assault rifles, but it will
        certainly put in work against opponents wielding pistols and SMGs.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">AK-47</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 143</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 111</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        The AK-47 has two major things going for it compared to the CT’s counterpart
        assault rifle: it can instantly kill an enemy regardless of whether they are equipped
        with armour or not, and it costs $400 less.
        The AK’s damage output is so high that you should be able to take down an enemy
        with four bullets - one bullet less than the CT’s M4A4.
        Utilising the AK’s high first shot accuracy, players can safely use this weapon at a
        variety of distances without having to worry about their shots missing the target.
        Missing your target forces the player to adjust to the AK’s heavy upwards recoil.
        Fortunately, this can be corrected by moving your mouse in the direction of the
        spray pattern. The ability to instantly kill armoured players is the reason why you’ll
        find CTs dropping their M4s for AKs - it is seriously that powerful!
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">M4A4</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 131</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 92</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        The M4A4 may lack the ability to instantly kill an armoured enemy with a headshot,
        but it makes up for this in a number of ways.
        Unlike most of the assault rifles in CS:GO, the M4A4 is incredibly accurate when
        fired at a distance. This high accuracy, coupled with average recoil allows the
        M4A4 to shine when burst fired at a distance.
        While a headshot may not be enough to kill enemies with armour, firing off a burst
        of three bullets should be accurate enough to compensate for the lack of damage.
        CTs looking for a stealthier option can opt for the M4A1-S.
        What the M4A1-S lacks in magazine capacity, it more than makes up for it with the
        built-in silencer which reduces recoil and increases accuracy.
        Be careful when trying to shoot through certain walls and boxes with the M4A1-S
        though, as the lack of ammunition forces you to consider every shot you make.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head">AWP</h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (UNARMOURED): 459</li>
            <li>HEADSHOT DMG (ARMOURED): 448</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        Widely regarded as the most iconic and deadly sniper rifle in the game, AWPers
        are either greatly respected, or mercilessly criticised for their skills with this
        weapon.
        While dealing four-fold lethal headshots on both armoured and unarmoured
        opponents sounds very appealing, hitting a shot anywhere except for a players
        legs will eliminate them, making body shots the preferred target for most players.
        Equipped with a scope that allows you to zoom twice by tapping right-click, this
        weapon is intended for stationary shots, taken at range.
        AWPers will often lurk in areas with lots of cover, as each shot is followed by a
        bolt-cycle animation, leaving players open to reactionary fire.
        The AWP’s hefty price tag makes it a choice for only the most confident players.
        They'll often have to actively save up in the rounds leading up to the purchase,
        making it detrimental to a team’s economy, if lost.

    <h1 class="head"> Turn off Windows mouse acceleration </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        Never rummaged around the innards of your PC’s mouse settings?
        It’s no surprise if you haven’t, as we certainly didn’t touch anything until we got
        serious about CS:GO in our attempts to climb the ranks.
        For a start, you’ve probably still got mouse acceleration turned on and that&#39;s the
        first priority to deal with.
        To explain things simply, having mouse acceleration turned on means that
        Windows subtly alters the way your cursor moves in its attempt to increase
        precision. It turns out this isn’t ideal when you want complete control over your
        pointer.
        Turning mouse acceleration off will mean Windows will stop tampering with your
        mouse, and it ensures that every mouse movement is yours and yours alone. You
        may not even notice it at first, but you’ll begin developing muscle memory for
        mouse sweeps and movements, developing inconsistencies in your aim that are a
        result of the computer awkwardly trying its best to help.
        Here’s how to turn off mouse acceleration:

    <h1 class="head"> How to find the best mouse DPI setting for you </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        First things first, you’ll need to get hold of a mouse that’s able to switch DPI for this
        to work. If you’re using the kind of plastic that came bundled with your PC, then it’s
        unlikely to support DPI switching.
        This needn't involve a hefty hit to the wallet, but rest assured that a proper gaming
        mouse is well worth the investment as you’ll reap the benefits across both
        videogames and productivity too.

        DPI stands for “Dots Per Inch”, and tweaking this setting dictates how many pixels
        you’ll glide over as you move your mouse. A player with 400 DPI will have to
        sweep their arm across the mousepad to shoot an enemy, while someone with
        1,200 DPI will only have to flick their wrist to achieve the same result. This isn’t to
        say that one’s better than the other - it’s all down to personal preference.
        Here’s a breakdown of low and high DPI ratings, with reasons as to why you may
        want to give them a whirl:
    </p>
    <h1 class="head"> Low DPI (400-800) </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        Setting your mouse to have low DPI means you’ll have to put more work in when
        moving the cursor. Often you’ll need to sweep your arm across the pad to turn
        around in games, or even to close tabs in a browser.
        We’ve found Low DPI settings of around 400-800 to be brilliant for precision-
        aiming, as you’ll begin building muscle memory. Just be warned that it does take
        some time getting used to.
        The one major drawback is the time it takes to reach your chosen destination if
        you’re not practiced with such a low setting.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head"> High DPI (1000-3000+) </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        We’ve not come across many players using 1000 DPI+, as it’s more of an acquired
        taste if you’re a fan of using your wrist instead of your arm when moving the
        mouse.
        Having such a high DPI means that you’ll be able to pull off your mouse clicks with
        a flick of the wrist, however your accuracy is more likely to suffer as there’s little
        leeway for your aim to be ever so slightly off the mark.
    </p>
    <h1 class="head"> What should I choose? </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        We’re not fans of putting, “It’s honestly up to you”, but in this case, it really is!
        We’d suggest giving both low and high DPI settings a go in a practice setting.
        Focus on moving, turning and shooting. Try and avoid standing still and see how it
        feels to turn a full 360 degrees on the fly, before aiming for the head of a bot.
        Force yourself to centre your aim before lining up headshots, or turn around and
        aim at enemies in the chest before spraying to see how you handle recoil. What
        we’re trying to say is, be creative and be thorough when giving both extremes a go.

        Finally, go for the DPI that feels most comfortable and start honing it in-game.
        Some mice come with software that allows you to fine tune the DPI of your mouse
        to the pixel, instead of being locked to moving up in increments. If there’s a DPI
        setting that doesn’t feel quite right, then try tweaking it until you’ve found the
        perfect sensitivity.

    <h1 class="head"> Best Resolution and Aspect Ratio </h1>
    <p class="txt">
        If you’ve ever watched some of the best CS:GO players in the world through
        streaming services like Twitch, then you’ll likely notice that their screen isn’t a clear
        1080p HD.
        Instead it probably looks a bit low quality and pretty zoomed in too. This is all down
        to the screen resolution and aspect ratio they’re playing at, with many long time CS
        players used to old monitors. They feel more comfortable playing the game with
        the screen settings they’ve always known.
        There are of course advantages and disadvantages to playing at lowered
        resolutions and aspect ratios. Before covering that though, we’ll take you through
        what’s available to you in-game:
    </p>
    <h1 class="head"> Aspect Ratios </h1>
    <ul>
        <div class="txt2">
            <li>16:9 - Most common.</li>
            <li>16:10 - Mainly used on newer monitors.</li>
            <li>4:3 - Old school. This will cause a “stretched” screen.</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="txt">
        Some players and many pros go with a 4:3 aspect ratio which means that the
        image you see on screen appears stretched and zoomed in. One of the main
        advantages of this aspect ratio is that you’re able to see enemies more clearly, and
        potentially even eliminate them more easily because their hitboxes are larger.
        One of the main drawbacks to a stretched 4:3 resolution is that you won’t be able
        to see the full width of the screen, meaning that you’ll have to put more work into
        your positioning and movement if you want to make sure that enemies don’t catch
        you out from the periphery.
        There’s not much to say about 16:9 as it’ll be a normal fit for your screen, allowing
        you to see absolutely everything with no stretching. Nothing will be zoomed in, so
        things will appear further away in comparison to 4:3. Personally, we prefer this over
        anything else.

        Much like sensitivity, it’s down to personal preference. Try them all out and see
        which one fits your playstyle.
        To change your resolution and aspect ratio at any time, head to the video settings
        menu and you'll be able to find them right at the top.
